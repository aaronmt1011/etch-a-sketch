<h1>Etch-a-sketch project!</h1>
<p>This project is about making a childhood game come to life, etch-a-sketch.</p>
<p>These are some guidelines for this project:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs</li>
    <li>Set up a “hover” effect so that the grid divs change color when your mouse passes over them, leaving a (pixelated) trail through your grid like a pen would</li>
    <li>Add a button to the top of the screen that will send the user a popup asking for the number of squares per side for the new grid. Once entered, the existing grid should be removed and a new grid should be generated in the same total space as before (e.g. 960px wide) so that you’ve got a new sketch pad. Tip: Set the limit for the user input to a maximum of 100. A larger number of squares results in more computer resources being used, potentially causing delays, freezing, or crashing that we want to prevent.</li>
